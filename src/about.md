# About

Software engineer working in Chicago, and [recent graduate](https://twitter.com/georgeblackm/status/995345329087270912) from the University of Wisconsin.

I love anything involving teaching, training, tutoring, leading, sharing, and speaking. In my open time, I [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17694443), [race](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbaOjHNnBY1/), and [take photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/georgemblack/albums).
