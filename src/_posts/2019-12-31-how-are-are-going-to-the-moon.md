A whole new generation (myself included) will experience a moon landing for the *first time* â€“ I couldn't be more giddy about this!

> It also includes a dedicated lunar station in orbit around the Moon, called Gateway. ... With a growing list of commercial and international opportunities, Gateway is the ideal hub between Earth and all that lies beyond. 

We're not only going back, we're *staying*.
