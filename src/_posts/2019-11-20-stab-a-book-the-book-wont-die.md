This is a wonderful essay by [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com) on the longstanding resiliency of books, and the "contracts" we subject ourselves to when engaging with them versus other media.

One of the most damning quotes (at least for myself):

> If habits define identity, then given the amount of time so many of us devote to reloading Twitter, opening Netflix, checking reddit, et cetera, are most of our identities that of media addict?

And the closing, which I love:

> Given its plainness, [a physical book] may be the most magical of all our contemporary technologies. It exists simply to be still, cannot be optimized, will never know us, and though a body is still while reading, the mind is active, telepathy is happening, and a sense of self-betterment and hope pervades as we turn the final page.
