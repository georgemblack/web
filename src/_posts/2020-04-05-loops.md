I'm up late, and I'm making scrambled eggs because that's what I have left in the fridge.

Here's a foggy sunset in my neighborhood; this was on my way to the grocery store a few days back. I'll need to go back in the morning.

It's not as apocalyptic as it looks of course – the following afternoon was sunny, with plenty of folk playing/walking/running in the park. (With plenty of distance between them.)

The lakefront is closed – this has condensed us all to little geographical zones.

Every day I walk the same loop near my apartment – around the block, around the park, repeat four times.

Patterns and rhythm are nice, so I enjoy my "loop". I've started noticing others with their loops around the park. I'll pass the same person enough times to feel obligated to say hello.

This will be life for awhile.

Wherever you are, I hope you are doing well. If not, I hope it doesn't last long.
