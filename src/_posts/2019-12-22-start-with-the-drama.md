> Most writing begins like this, without any sense of motion at all. It stops and starts. It sputters forwards as if it doesnâ€™t want us to continue reading. So to make our writing better than all this we must do something extraordinary and unheard of; we must hold off on the introduction, delete all of the unnecessary context, and start things off with a bang.

> Because every good story begins in the middle.
