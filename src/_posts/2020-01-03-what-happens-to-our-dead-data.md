Will our listing on Ancestry.com link to 10,000 old Facebook photos?

Is it worth keeping a tweet from 2,000 years ago?

Will a third-party company collect our data, and keep it only if someone pays a fee?

Will there be a day when even [Amazon Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) is too expensive? (It's $0.00099/GB for Deep Archive.)

Of the ~108 billion people born, most have *no record of their existence*.

Many that do, have only a worn-down gravestone, a signature on a legal document, or a photo in someone's attic. Even these will eventually be lost.

Humans are finite; time is not. We generate heaps of digital data that we do not destroy. So what will happen to our "dead" data?

Fun side note: This insignificant blog post will last for 1,000 years in an [arctic vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/#arctic-code-vault).
