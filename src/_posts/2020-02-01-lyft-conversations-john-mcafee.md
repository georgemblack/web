My Lyft driver, a few weeks ago, paraphrased:

"In order for society to work, people have to act a certain way. There's a norm, there's behavior we consider normal, you know? There are expectations.

"You are young, so I expect something different from you than someone who is older. But you are educated, yes? Then I expect you to speak as an educated person in society.

"Someone who is older, well, we expect *wisdom* from them.

"But.. John McAfee? That crazy man, you know what he said? He said if Bitcoin doesn't reach $1 million by 2020, *he will cut off his dick and eat it on television*. Nobody was asking for that! Everybody said, 'you're crazy man'. Then he says, 'if Bitcoin doesn't reach *$2 million* by 2020, I will cut off my dick and eat it on television!'

"He's out on the edge, and you just can't do that man. I mean, he does security for *Microsoft* â€“ you just can't be doing that."

(Later on, we are driving by construction workers in the bitter cold.)

"That's what I love about this place, people work hard, and they do their work. That's the spirit of these people [here in Chicago].

"I'm an accountant, and I drive on the weekends, that's what we do, we don't sit around.

"I also own 1.5 bitcoin. It's going to be huge."

**Five stars.**
