Will our listings on Ancestry.com link to 10,000 photos we once uploaded to Facebook?

Will third-party companies collect our ancient data, and keep it only for a fee? Or auction it off like abandon storage units?

Is it *worth* storing a tweet from 2,000 years ago?

Will there be a day when even [Glacier Deep Archive](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) is too expensive? ($0.00099/GB!)

When do we start *deleting* things?

Of the ~108 billion people born, most have **no record of their existence**. Many that do, have only a worn-down gravestone, a signature on a legal document, or a photo in someone's attic. Even these will eventually be lost.

Humans are finite; time is not. We generate heaps of digital data that we do not destroy. So what happens to our "dead" data?

Fun side note: This insignificant blog post will last for 1,000 years in an [arctic vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/#arctic-code-vault).
