The headline is clickbait-y, and to be honest, I have never heard of Doist.

But I found a very personal connection to this writer's story about dropping everything:

> When I was 23 years old, I broke up with my girlfriend, sold or gave away most of my stuff, packed a single suitcase, and booked a one-way ticket from Denmark to Taiwan... At the time, I had no idea that this would be the start of the unhappiest period of my life.

I recently had a similar experience – moving from midwestern United States to the east coast. It's not as dramatic as Denmark to Taiwan, but nonetheless:

> ...you lose your social circle, your sense of belonging, and the everyday routines that keep you grounded and healthy. You also quickly discover that meeting new people is easy, but making new friends — real friends — is hard, especially if you’re starting from zero.

This is exactly why I made my way back to the midwest, one year later.

Without a community, group, or "tribe" to center and ground you, it becomes easy to get pulled into a deep state of lonliness. It's disorienting.

> No matter what Airbnb might tell you, you cannot "belong anywhere" instantly. Community takes time to build — there are no shortcuts.

I wasn't ready to invest the time and energy it takes to build a new community – I opted to return to what I already have.

This whole process instilled in me a strong appreciation for the friendships I *do* have, and the critical importance of maintaining them.
