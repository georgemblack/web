I found myself unexpectedly interested in the legality of milk on the Senate floor, gossip in the cloakroom, and importantly, substantive discussion on matters of impeachment.

Whether or not you like Cruz – the podcast is refreshingly unfiltered and free from "headline noise". It's concise and well-explained for the majority of Americans (myself included) that have tuned out, without condescension. I appreciate that.

Apparently, something is resonating. It's the number one podcast in the U.S., and has been for almost a week.

I would love more shows of this format in the future – not just from Republicans, and not just on matters of impeachment, either.
